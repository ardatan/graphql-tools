Schema stitching (`@graphql-tools/stitch`) creates a single GraphQL gateway schema from multiple underlying GraphQL services. Unlike [schema merging](/docs/merge-schemas), which simply combines local schema instances, stitching builds a combined proxy layer that delegates requests through to underlying service APIs. As of GraphQL Tools v7, stitching is fairly comparable to [Apollo Federation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/federation/) with automated query planning, merged types, and declarative schema directives.

## Topics

Browse the following documentation topics to learn about stitching libraries, or review the [Schema Stitching Handbook](https://github.com/gmac/schema-stitching-handbook) for working examples of major stitching features.

- [Combining multiple schemas](/docs/stitch-combining-schemas)

## Basic example

Given two self-contained subschemas, a single "stitched" schema can be built that delegates (or, proxies) relevant portions of a request to each subservice:

```js
import { makeExecutableSchema } from '@graphql-tools/schema';
import { stitchSchemas } from '@graphql-tools/stitch';
import { stitchingDirectives } from '@graphql-tools/stitching-directives';

const postsService = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs: `
    type Post {
      id: ID!
      message: String!
      author: User
    }

    type User {
      id: ID!
      posts: [Post]
    }

    type Query {
      post(id: ID!): Post
      users(ids: [ID!]!): [User]! @merge(keyField: "id")
    }
  `,
  resolvers: {
    // ...
  },
});

const usersService = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs: `
    type User {
      id: ID!
      username: String!
      email: String!
    }

    type Query {
      users(ids: [ID!]!): [User]! @merge(keyField: "id") @canonical
    }
  `,
  resolvers: {
    // ...
  },
});

const { stitchingDirectivesTransformer } = stitchingDirectives({
  // options...
});

const gatewaySchema = stitchSchemas({
  subschemaConfigTransforms: [stitchingDirectivesTransformer],
  subschemas: [
    { schema: postsSchema, batch: true },
    { schema: usersSchema, batch: true },
  ],
});
```

Using the stitched proxy schema, data may be requested interchangeably from any service in the same request:

```graphql
query {
  users(ids: ["1", "2"]) {
    username
    email
    posts {
      message
      author {
        username
        email
      }
    }
  }
}
```
