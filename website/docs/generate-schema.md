The graphql-tools package allows you to create a GraphQL.js GraphQLSchema instance from GraphQL schema language using the function `makeExecutableSchema`.

## Example

When using `graphql-tools`, you describe the schema as a GraphQL type language string:

```js
const typeDefs = `
  type Author {
    id: Int!
    firstName: String
    lastName: String
    """
    the list of Posts by this author
    """
    posts: [Post]
  }

  type Post {
    id: Int!
    title: String
    author: Author
    votes: Int
  }

  # the schema allows the following query:
  type Query {
    posts: [Post]
    author(id: Int!): Author
  }

  # this schema allows the following mutation:
  type Mutation {
    upvotePost (
      postId: Int!
    ): Post
  }
`;
```

Then you define resolvers as a nested object that maps type and field names to resolver functions:

```js
import { find, filter } from 'lodash';

// example data
const authors = [
  { id: 1, firstName: 'Tom', lastName: 'Coleman' },
  { id: 2, firstName: 'Sashko', lastName: 'Stubailo' },
  { id: 3, firstName: 'Mikhail', lastName: 'Novikov' },
];

const posts = [
  { id: 1, authorId: 1, title: 'Introduction to GraphQL', votes: 2 },
  { id: 2, authorId: 2, title: 'Welcome to Meteor', votes: 3 },
  { id: 3, authorId: 2, title: 'Advanced GraphQL', votes: 1 },
  { id: 4, authorId: 3, title: 'Launchpad is Cool', votes: 7 },
];

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    posts: () => posts,
    author: (_, { id }) => find(authors, { id }),
  },

  Mutation: {
    upvotePost: (_, { postId }) => {
      const post = find(posts, { id: postId });
      if (!post) {
        throw new Error(`Couldn't find post with id ${postId}`);
      }
      post.votes += 1;
      return post;
    },
  },

  Author: {
    posts: author => filter(posts, { authorId: author.id }),
  },

  Post: {
    author: post => find(authors, { id: post.authorId }),
  },
};
```

At the end, the schema and resolvers are combined using `makeExecutableSchema`:

```js
import { makeExecutableSchema } from 'graphql-tools';

export const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});
```

This example has the entire type definition in one string and all resolvers in one object, but you can combine types and resolvers from multiple files, as documented in the [extending types](#extending-types) section below.

## Extending Types

It's easy to add additional fields to existing types using the `extend` keyword.  Using `extend` is particularly useful in avoiding a large list of fields on root Queries and Mutations.  You can use it like this:

```js
const typeDefs = [`
  schema {
    query: Query
  }

  type Query {
    bars: [Bar]!
  }

  type Bar {
    id
  }
  `, `
  type Foo {
    id: String!
  }

  extend type Query {
    foos: [Foo]!
  }
`]
```

If one of the types extended needs a resolver you can use `makeExecutableSchema` like this:

```js
const barsResolver = {
  Query: {
    bars(parent, args, context, info) {
      // ...
    }
  }
};

const foosResolver = {
  Query: {
    foos(parent, args, context, info) {
      // ...
    }
  }
}

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers: [barsResolver, foosResolver]
})
```

## Learning the GraphQL schema language

The official documentation on graphql.org now has [a section about GraphQL schemas](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/) which explains all of the different schema features and how to use them with the schema language.

The type definitions must define a query type, which means a minimal schema would look something like this:
```js
const typeDefs = [`
  schema {
    query: RootQuery
  }

  type RootQuery {
    aNumber: Int
  }
`];
```

## Descriptions & Deprecations

GraphiQL has built-in support for displaying docstrings with markdown syntax. You can easily add docstrings to types, fields and arguments like below:

```
"""
Description for the type
"""
type MyObjectType {
  """
  Description for field
  Supports multi-line description
  """
  myField: String!

  otherField(
    """
    Description for argument
    """
    arg: Int
  )

  oldField(
    """
    Description for argument
    """
    arg: Int
  ) @deprecated(reason: "Use otherField instead.")
}
```

This [GraphQL schema language cheat sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sogko/graphql-shorthand-notation-cheat-sheet/master/graphql-shorthand-notation-cheat-sheet.png) by Hafiz Ismail is an excellent reference for all the features of the GraphQL schema language.

## API

### makeExecutableSchema(options)

`makeExecutableSchema` takes a single argument: an object of options. Only the `typeDefs` option is required.

```
import { makeExecutableSchema } from 'graphql-tools';

const jsSchema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers, // optional
  logger, // optional
  allowUndefinedInResolve: false, // optional
  resolverValidationOptions: {}, // optional
  directiveResolvers: null, // optional
  schemaDirectives: null,  // optional
  parseOptions: {},  // optional
  inheritResolversFromInterfaces: false  // optional
});
```

- `typeDefs` is a required argument and should be an GraphQL schema language string or array of GraphQL schema language strings or a function that takes no arguments and returns an array of GraphQL schema language strings. The order of the strings in the array is not important, but it must include a schema definition.

- `resolvers` is an optional argument _(empty object by default)_ and should be an object or an array of objects that follow the pattern explained in [article on resolvers](/docs/resolvers/)

- `logger` is an optional argument, which can be used to print errors to the server console that are usually swallowed by GraphQL. The `logger` argument should be an object with a `log` function, eg. `const logger = { log: e => console.log(e) }`

- `parseOptions` is an optional argument which allows customization of parse when specifying `typeDefs` as a string.

- `allowUndefinedInResolve` is an optional argument, which is `true` by default. When set to `false`, causes your resolver to throw errors if they return undefined, which can help make debugging easier.

- `resolverValidationOptions` is an optional argument which accepts an `ResolverValidationOptions` object which has the following boolean properties:
  - `requireResolversForArgs` will cause `makeExecutableSchema` to throw an error if no resolver is defined for a field that has arguments.

  - `requireResolversForNonScalar` will cause `makeExecutableSchema` to throw an error if a non-scalar field has no resolver defined. Setting this to `true` can be helpful in catching errors, but defaults to `false` to avoid confusing behavior for those coming from other GraphQL libraries.

  - `requireResolversForAllFields` asserts that *all* fields have valid resolvers.

  - `requireResolversForResolveType` will require a `resolveType()` method for Interface and Union types. This can be passed in with the field resolvers as `__resolveType()`. False to disable the warning.

  - `allowResolversNotInSchema` turns off the functionality which throws errors when resolvers are found which are not present in the schema. Defaults to `false`, to help catch common errors.

- `inheritResolversFromInterfaces` GraphQL Objects that implement interfaces will inherit missing resolvers from their interface types defined in the `resolvers` object.
