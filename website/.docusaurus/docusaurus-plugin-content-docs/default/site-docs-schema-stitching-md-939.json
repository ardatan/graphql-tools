  "description": "Schema stitching (@graphql-tools/stitch) creates a single GraphQL gateway schema from multiple underlying GraphQL services. Unlike schema merging, which simply combines local schema instances, stitching builds a combined proxy layer that delegates requests through to underlying service APIs. As of GraphQL Tools v7, stitching is a comparable alternative to Apollo Federation with automated query planning, merged types, and declarative schema directives.",
