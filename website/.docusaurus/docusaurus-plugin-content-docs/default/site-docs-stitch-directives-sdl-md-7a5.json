  "description": "Stitching directives (@graphql-tools/stitching-directives) may be used to configure a stitched gateway directly through the Schema Definition Language (SDL) of its subservices. The advantage of this approach is that all schema and type merging configuration is represented in a single document managed by each subservice, and can be reloaded by the gateway on the fly without a formal deploy or server restart.",
