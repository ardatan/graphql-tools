# Migration from GraphQL Toolkit

GraphQL Toolkit was first built for keeping shared utilities of GraphQL Modules, GraphQL Code Generator, GraphQL CLI, GraphQL Inspector, Merge GraphQL Schemas and GraphQL Import, but we decided to merge this package into GraphQL Tools. So there are some small changes you need to do to replace the old GraphQL Toolkit with the new GraphQL Tools in your project/library.

### Common package (`@graphql-toolkit/common`)

`@graphql-toolkit/common` is kept under `@graphql-tools/utils` except for the Resolvers Composition feature. This feature can be found in `@graphql-tools/resolvers-composition`.

### Type Definitions and Schema Loader packages (`@graphql-toolkit/core`)

That package was renamed to `@graphql-tools/load` with the same API. All loader packages have been renamed to `@graphql-tools/*-loader`.
GraphQL Import logic extracted to `@graphql-tools/import`.

### Type Definitions, Resolvers and Schema Merging (`@graphql-toolkit/schema-merging`)

That package was renamed to `@graphql-tools/merge` with the same API.

### File Loading (`@graphql-toolkit/file-loading`)

That package was renamed to `@graphql-tools/load-files` with the same API.
