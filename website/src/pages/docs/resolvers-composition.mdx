# Resolvers Composition

Composition tool for GraphQL, with helpers to combine multiple resolvers into one, specify dependencies between fields, and more.

When developing a GraphQL server, it is common to perform some authorization logic on your resolvers, usually based on the context of a request. With Resolvers Composition you can easily accomplish that and still make the code decoupled - thus testable - by combining multiple single-logic resolvers into one.

The following is an example of a simple logged-in authorization logic:

Instead of doing this:

```js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    myQuery(root, args, context) {
      // Make sure that the user is authenticated
      if (!context.currentUser) {
        throw new Error('You are not authenticated!')
      }

      // Make sure that the user has the correct roles
      if (!context.currentUser.roles || context.currentUser.roles.includes('EDITOR')) {
        throw new Error('You are not authorized!')
      }

      // Business logic
      if (args.something === '1') {
        return true
      }

      return false
    }
  }
}
```

You can do:

```js
const { composeResolvers } = require('@graphql-tools/resolvers-composition')

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    myQuery(root, args, context) {
      if (args.something === '1') {
        return true
      }

      return false
    }
  }
}

const isAuthenticated = () => next => (root, args, context, info) => {
  if (!context.currentUser) {
    throw new Error('You are not authenticated!')
  }

  return next(root, args, context, info)
}

const hasRole = (role: string) => next => (root, args, context, info) => {
  if (!context.currentUser.roles?.includes(role)) {
    throw new Error('You are not authorized!')
  }

  return next(root, args, context, info)
}

const resolversComposition = {
  'Query.myQuery': [isAuthenticated(), hasRole('EDITOR')]
}

const composedResolvers = composeResolvers(resolvers, resolversComposition)
```

`composeResolvers` is a method in `@graphql-tools/resolvers-composition` package that accepts `IResolvers` object and mappings for composition functions that would be run before resolver itself.

## Supported Path Matcher Format

The paths for resolvers support `*` wildcard for types and glob patterns for fields. For example:

- `*.*` - all types and all fields
- `Query.*` - all queries
- `Query.single` - only a single query
- `Query.{first, second}` - queries for first/second
- `Query.!first` - all queries but first
- `Query.!{first, second}` - all queries but first/second
