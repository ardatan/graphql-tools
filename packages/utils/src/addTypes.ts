// addTypes uses toConfig to create a new schema with a new or replaced
// type or directive. Rewiring is employed so that the replaced type can be
// reconnected with the existing types.
//
// Rewiring is employed even for new types or directives as a convenience, so
// that type references within the new type or directive do not have to be to
// the identical objects within the original schema.
//
// In fact, the type references could even be stub types with entirely different
// fields, as long as the type references share the same name as the desired
// type within the original schema's type map.
//
// This makes it easy to perform simple schema operations (e.g. adding a new
// type with a fiew fields removed from an existing type) that could normally be
// performed by using toConfig directly, but is blocked if any intervening
// more advanced schema operations have caused the types to be recreated via
// rewiring.
//
// Type recreation happens, for example, with every use of mapSchema, as the
// types are always rewired. If fields are selected and removed using
// mapSchema, adding those fields to a new type can no longer be simply done
// by toConfig, as the types are not the identical JavaScript objects, and
// schema creation will fail with errors referencing multiple types with the
// same names.
//
// enhanceSchema can fill this gap by adding an additional round of rewiring.
